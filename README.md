# PT-project-vulnerability


## Objective

The objective of the **PT-project-vunlnerability** project was to write a simple script where the user inputs a single or a range of ip addresses,
then Nmap scans these addresses for:
1. hosts that are up
2. open ports
3. the services that are running on those ports
4. the versions of said services

- All that information from the Namp scans is then stored in unique files according to the the IP address that was canned.
-Then, the results are used to perform a search in the Searchsploit local database, if there are hits, the possible exploits are added into the initial file 
 created from the Nmap scan.
- the 3rd stage is where the script will try to find weak passwords via brute forcing open services like: SSH, TELNET, FTP
  with user and password files provided in the start. 


### Skills Learned

- Getting familiar with the **Nmap Scritping Engine**
- Learning about the **SearchSploit** framework.
- Better understanding of conditions in scripting.



### Tools Used

- Searchsploit
- Nmap scripting engine (for brute force)

- File Operations:
    * mv
    * ls -1
    * -d
    * -z
- Text Processing:
   * grep
   * sed
   * awk
   * cut
- Control Flow:
   * for
   * while
   * if

## How to use

Make sure you are operating as root or as a user that belongs to the sudo group.
Start the script by typing: pt-project_vunlner.sh or ./pt-project_vunlner.sh
The script with output the information into to the terminal and a folder in your current directory
